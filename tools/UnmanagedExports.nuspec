    <description>A set of compile-time libraries (nothing to deploy) and a build task that enable you to export functions from managed code to native applications.
      That means, you can create plugins in a managed language like C# or F# for native applications that only have a C-Api (like Notepad++).
      The nuget package is all you need. Just mark your methods with [DllExport] and build for x86, x64 or ia64.

      Hints:
      - You have to set your platform target to either x86, ia64 or x64. AnyCPU assemblies cannot export functions.
      - The export name defaults to the method name and the calling convention to stdcall. If that's all what you want, you can just use [DllExport] without parameters.
      - You cannot put your exports in generic types or export generic methods. (The CLR wouldn't know what type parameters to use)</description>
    <summary>Adds the ability to declare unmanaged function exports.
      IOW: the exact opposite of how DllImport works.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>- will use the most recent version of Microsoft.Build.Utilities.ToolLocationHelper to have a greater chance of finding the exact ildasm/ilasm for the project's target framework version

- no longer fails the build when it can't find lib.exe

- proper overridable MSBuild properties (see tools/RGiesecke.DllExport.targets)</releaseNotes>
