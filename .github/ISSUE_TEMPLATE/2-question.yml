        Please try MSDN, Stack Overflow, and other relevant places to understand any UNEXPECTED behavior with your code.
        P/Invoke, dotnet domains, marshaling, multithreading, assembly resolving, scalar & unmanaged native types, ... and so on,
        are not directly related to the .NET DllExport; and this issue tracker is not the best place to start learning the basics of these things. Thanks!
