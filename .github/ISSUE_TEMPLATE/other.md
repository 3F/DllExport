## ! Important

1. **Try to use** only [GitHub for your attachments and screenshots](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/) instead of other places. It's free, it's enough.
2. **Do not** put inside message any very long text data ( ~ 10 Kb+ time for attachments ). Means only as file (text-based, or zip, etc). Because we're receiving this notification through email, so it's really ... [100K+](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/71)
3. Please try to use [**basic formatting** for your code examples](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/), to avoid code dancing ðŸ•º across the page.
