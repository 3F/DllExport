The original tool `UnmanagedExports` has been distributed without any source code, the only this:

* [Official page](https://sites.google.com/site/robertgiesecke/Home/uploads/unmanagedexports) - *posted Jul 9, 2009 [ updated Dec 19, 2012 ]*
* [Official NuGet Packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnmanagedExports) 
    * the only known [contact with author](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnmanagedExports/ContactOwners) - but it seems also is outdated, I have also tried this.

However, not all so bad... we have the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) for all of this !

It says:
