public static int entrypoint(IntPtr l)
{
    // ... it will be called from Lua script

    lua_pushcclosure(l, onProc, 0);

}
```

* If you need convenient work with Lua (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, ...), see [LunaRoad](https://github.com/3F/LunaRoad)

```csharp
[DllExport("Init", CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
// __cdecl is the default calling convention for our library as and for C and C++ programs
[DllExport(CallingConvention.StdCall)]
[DllExport("MyFunc")]
[DllExport]
```

Support of Modules: Library (**.dll**) and Executable (**.exe**) [[?](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/18)]


Where to look ? v1.2+ provides dynamic definitions of namespaces (ddNS feature), thus you can use what you need - details **[here](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/2)**

### How does it work

Current features has been implemented through [ILDasm](https://github.com/3F/coreclr/tree/master/src/ildasm) & [ILAsm](https://github.com/3F/coreclr/tree/master/src/ilasm) that makes the all required steps via `.export` directive ([it's specific directive for ILAsm compiler only](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/45#issuecomment-317802099)).

**What inside ? or how does work the .export directive ?**

Read about format PE32/PE32+, start with grammar from asmparse and move to writer:

```cpp
...
//yacc
if(PASM->m_pCurMethod->m_dwExportOrdinal == 0xFFFFFFFF)
{
  PASM->m_pCurMethod->m_dwExportOrdinal = $3;
  PASM->m_pCurMethod->m_szExportAlias = $6;
  if(PASM->m_pCurMethod->m_wVTEntry == 0) PASM->m_pCurMethod->m_wVTEntry = 1;
  if(PASM->m_pCurMethod->m_wVTSlot  == 0) PASM->m_pCurMethod->m_wVTSlot = $3 + 0x8000;
}
...
EATEntry*   pEATE = new EATEntry;
pEATE->dwOrdinal = pMD->m_dwExportOrdinal;
pEATE->szAlias = pMD->m_szExportAlias ? pMD->m_szExportAlias : pMD->m_szName;
pEATE->dwStubRVA = EmitExportStub(pGlobalLabel->m_GlobalOffset+dwDelta);
m_EATList.PUSH(pEATE);
...
// logic of definition of records into EXPORT_DIRECTORY (see details from PE format)
HRESULT Assembler::CreateExportDirectory()  
{
...
    IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY  exportDirIDD;
    DWORD                   exportDirDataSize;
    BYTE                   *exportDirData;
    EATEntry               *pEATE;
    unsigned                i, L, ordBase = 0xFFFFFFFF, Ldllname;
    ...
    ~ now we're ready to miracles ~
```

### How to get DllExport

**v1.6+** have no official support of any standard NuGet clients. [[?](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/wiki/DllExport-Manager-Q-A)]

* [New Wizard and embeddable manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBWt-KdQtoc)
    * Wiki. [Quick start](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/wiki/Quick-start)

Get [DllExport.bat](https://3F.github.io/DllExport/releases/latest/manager/) from any place. For example, you can still get it from packages via NuGet server ([how to](https://youtu.be/okPThdWDZMM?t=1m1s)) or it also can be embedded inside any other your scripts/project files/etc.

*DllExport.bat was based on [GetNuTool core](https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool) that's Cross-Platform Embeddable Package Manager that requires only MSBuild. Finally it just aggregates calling to Wizard that was based on [MvsSln](https://github.com/3F/MvsSln). [[?](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/wiki/DllExport-Manager-Q-A#is-this-cross-platform-solution-)]*

**Please note**: You do not need to call manually DllExport.bat after initial configuration. It will be **automatically** restored by any Build operation for your configured projects.


* To install/uninstall or to reconfigure your projects:

```
DllExport -action Configure
```

[Please read the documentation.](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/wiki/DllExport-Manager)


Other variants:

* `gnt /p:ngpackages="DllExport"` [[?](https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool)]
    * [GetNuTool](https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool): `msbuild gnt.core /p:ngpackages="DllExport"` or [`gnt`](https://3F.github.io/GetNuTool/releases/latest/gnt/)` /p:ngpackages="DllExport"`
* (deprecated) NuGet PM: `Install-Package DllExport`
* (deprecated) NuGet Commandline: `nuget install DllExport`
* [/releases](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/releases) [ [latest stable](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/releases/latest) ]
* [Nightly builds](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/3Fs/dllexport/history) (`/artifacts` page). But remember: It can be unstable or not work at all. Use this for tests of latest changes.
  * Artifacts [older than 6 months](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/packaging-artifacts/#artifacts-retention-policy) you can also find as `Pre-release` with mark `ðŸŽ² Nightly build` on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/releases) page.

### How to Build

Use build.bat if you need final binaries (NuGet package as `DllExport.<version>.nupkg`, Manager, zip-archive, and others).

```bash
> build
```

Part of this build scripts works via vssbe ([?](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/31#issuecomment-294231378)) and for build via console (including CI etc.) uses [CIM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/vsSBE.CI.MSBuild/) version of this. So you do not need anything else, just type `build`.

For Visual Studio use this [vsix version for IDE](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0d1dbfd7-ed8a-40af-ae39-281bfeca2334/)

### How to Debug

Wizard through MSBuild, for example:

```
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe
```

Arguments:

```bash
"net.r_eg.DllExport.Wizard.targets" /p:wRootPath="<...>" 
/p:wSlnFile="<SolutionFile_for_debugging>.sln" /p:wAction="Configure" 
/p:wPkgPath=packages/DllExport<version>
```

Working directory:
```
<path_to>\packages\DllExport<version>\tools
```

DllExport.MSBuild, for example:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe
```

Arguments:

```bash
"<path_to_SolutionFile_for_debugging>.sln" /t:Build /p:Configuration=<Configuration>
```

use additional `Diagnostic` key to msbuild if you need more details:
```bash
"<SolutionFile>.sln" /verbosity:Diagnostic /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=<Configuration>
```

Now you can debug at runtime.

### coreclr - ILAsm / ILDasm

We use **our custom versions on coreclr**, special for DllExport project - https://github.com/3F/coreclr

This helps to avoid some problems ([like this](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/17)) and more...

*To build minimal version (means that it does not include all components as for original coreclr repo):*

* Restore git submodule or use repo: https://github.com/3F/coreclr.git

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

*Make sure that you have installed [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), then build simply:*

```bash
build_s all x86 x64 Release
build_s x86 Release
```

or use
```bash
build_coreclr_x86.cmd
build_coreclr_x86_x64.cmd
```

*You can also use our binaries of coreclr separately if needed:*

* [![NuGet package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ILAsm.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ILAsm/)
* Look also [here](https://github.com/3F/coreclr/issues/1)


### Donation

Please note again, the initial [UnmanagedExports](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnmanagedExports) was created by Robert Giesecke. You should [visit its page](https://sites.google.com/site/robertgiesecke/Home/uploads/unmanagedexports) if you need.

But this repository does not related with Robert and generally **still** being developed by [github.com/3F](https://github.com/3F) developer (Follow: [[GitHub](https://github.com/3F)]; [[G+](https://plus.google.com/+DenisKuzmin3F)]). **So** if you think that our improvements, fixes, other changes, support, information, I don't know... if something are helpful for you from this, donations are welcome, and thanks !
