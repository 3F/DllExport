# Code of Conduct

Before submitting anything you are obliged to **make sure you have all the rights** to the materials you post.

Neither the owner nor the contributors of the project *.NET DllExport* ( https://github.com/3F/DllExport ) do **NOT** conduct any checks on such publications made by third parties in official repository, issue tracker, furums, chats, and other types of social interactions as part of the *.NET DllExport* project. This includes (but is not limited to): source code, attachments, screenshots, logs, contacts, logins/passwords, product/license keys, url links, other possible sensitive information from examples and so on.

The responsibility lies solely with **you** who originally sends/provides/opens something.

## Be friendly and patient

[*.NET DllExport*](https://github.com/3F/DllExport) is **NOT** a commercial project ! None of the project participants fulfill paid orders based on your requests and, accordingly, cannot bear any obligations to you.

Here everything was done (and continues to be done) primarily on [own initiative](https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/219#issuecomment-1429722848) and moreover almost entirely at own expense and free time (or what are the breaks between sleep and food called for someone); so you can only provide your own support somehow to speed this up and be patient. Thanks for understanding!

## Be respectful

In all senses, please respect other people's work. They are spending their precious time trying to help in any of its forms: from source code to answers, etc., even if they are not getting paid for it at all.

Note [*.NET DllExport*](https://github.com/3F/DllExport) and its various parts may include or reference different software components. You must follow their accompanying licenses depending on their use.

## Reporting

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct you can report in official issue tracker ( https://github.com/3F/DllExport/issues/new/choose ) or in a private conversation with OWNER.
